Marin Prep Java
==============

- abstract class vs interface
  - abstract class can have concrete methods while interface cannot
  - interface's fields have to be `public static final` while abstract class's fields dont have to
  - interface's methods have to be public while abstract class's methods can be private, protected and public
  - you can extend only one anstract class while you can implement multiple interfaces
