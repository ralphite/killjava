- abstract class vs interface
  - abstract class can have concrete methods while interface cannot
  - interface's fields have to be `public static final` while abstract class's fields dont have to
  - interface's methods have to be public while abstract class's methods can be private, protected and public
  - you can extend only one anstract class while you can implement multiple interfaces

- TreeMap
  - a red-black tree based NavigatableMap implementation

- **understand trees, heaps and PriorityQueues**


- questions
  - `DONE` find common chars in two strings
  - `DONE` find anagrams in a list of strings
  - find the nth biggest number from a long list of numbers (O(n) quickselect)
  - find the 10 biggest numbers in from a long list of numbers
  - `DONE` find the most frequently used word in a string
  - `DONE` print the correct sentense in the correct order
  - `DONE` Check whether two strings are anagram of each other
  - `DONE` compare abstract class and interface
  - `DONE` what is 4 left shift 2 XOR 2
  - `DONE` what is the value of a number with all bits as 0 except the leftmost one - **MINIMUM_VALUE**
  - explain a TreeMap
  - what methods do you have to implement to make the object properly comparable
  - `DONE` given 2 sets, determine if the second set is a subset of the first
  - how is a HashSet implemented
  - standard tree questions whiteboard coding
  - Date vs calendar
  - long vs object long
  - what is abstract class, how do you instantiate it ?
  - int vs integer for counting number of times for loop runs
  - worst case node addition time in BST
  - hashmap node addition time
  - hashmap methods - name any 7 of them
  - `DONE` what is a final class
  - `DONE` difference between private vs protected keywords
  - `DONE` difference between list and set
  - `DONE` Each interviewer had a java programing question in mind and asked to code it on the white board. Some were tough ones and some were easy. eq, Str rev, Factorial, Fibonacci series. etc
  - `DONE` There was one product manager who actually gave me their web tool and asked me to find bugs on it and actually asked me to file the bug in bugzilla, this was kind of cool.
  - `DONE` Write a program to find factorial of a number - can use `java.math.BigInteger` which is not well designed
  - `DONE` Write a program to find the magic triangle or summation n
  - `DONE` [Quality Assurance Engineer Interview](http://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Marin-Software-Quality-Assurance-Engineer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE113537.0,14_KO15,41.htm#RVW1206833)
  - java concepts and bst questions
  - How would you design a web application that handles text lists as well as lists of lists?
